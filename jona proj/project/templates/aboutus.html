                <h3>General Assembly</h3>

                <p>The General Assembly is the main deliberative, policymaking and
                    representative organ of the UN. All 193 Member States of the UN are
                    represented in the General Assembly, making it the only UN body with
                    universal representation.  Each year, in September, the full UN
                    membership meets in the General Assembly Hall in New York for the
                    annual General Assembly session, and general debate, which many heads
                    of state attend and address. Decisions on important questions, such
                    as those on peace and security, admission of new members and budgetary
                    matters, require a two-thirds majority of the General Assembly.
                    Decisions on other questions are by simple majority.  The General
                    Assembly, each year, elects a GA President to serve a one-year term
                    of office.</p>

                <h3>Security Council</h3>

                <p>
                    The Security Council has primary responsibility, under the UN Charter,
                    for the maintenance of international peace and security.  It has 15
                    Members (5 permanent and 10 non-permanent members). Each Member has
                    one vote. Under the Charter, all Member States are obligated to comply
                    with Council decisions. The Security Council takes the lead in
                    determining the existence of a threat to the peace or act of
                    aggression. It calls upon the parties to a dispute to settle it
                    by peaceful means and recommends methods of adjustment or terms of
                    settlement. In some cases, the Security Council can resort to imposing
                    sanctions or even authorize the use of force to maintain or restore
                    international peace and security.  The Security Council has a
                    Presidency, which rotates, and changes, every month.

                <h3>Economic and Social Council</h3>

                <p>The Economic and Social Council is the principal body for coordination,
                    policy review, policy dialogue and recommendations on economic,
                    social and environmental issues, as well as implementation of
                    internationally agreed development goals. It serves as the central
                    mechanism for activities of the UN system and its specialized agencies
                    in the economic, social and environmental fields, supervising
                    subsidiary and expert bodies.  It has 54 Members, elected by the
                    General Assembly for overlapping three-year terms. It is the United
                    Nations’ central platform for reflection, debate, and innovative
                    thinking on sustainable development.
