            <h5>Deliver Humanitarian Aid</h5>

            <p>
                One of the purposes of the United Nations, as stated in its Charter,
                is "to achieve international co-operation in solving international
                problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character.
                " The UN first did this in the aftermath of the Second World War on
                the devastated continent of Europe, which it helped to rebuild.

                The Organization is now relied upon by the international community
                to coordinate humanitarian relief of emergencies due to natural and
                man-made disasters in areas beyond the relief capacity of national
                authorities alone.
